# ELEC-301

These files are the final verison of the mini-projects in ELEC 301 (Circuit Design).

The projects contains the advanced knowledge of the design of the elctronic circuit; biasing of and small-signal models for different types of transistors.The mini-project 2, 3 and 4 include the frequency repsonse of amplifiers, feedback and the stability aspects of amplifier design.The principles of OP-AMPs, active filters and oscilllators are also included.

The circuits are designed and implemented in Circuitmaker.

This purpose of this material is to share the electrical and electronic knowledge. Please only use this for studying and DO NOT cheat using this material.
